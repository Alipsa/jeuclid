Logo contest

 is anyone out there interested in creating a good JEuclid logo? This is needed 
for 

 * the website,

 * bean support,

 * clickable application for os-x users.

 Therefore, we'd need two logos:

 * a square logo as an icon, and

 * a larger logo as a generic logo.

 Ideally, the logo should be in a scalable format (such as svg or mml) and 
should also look good in a black-n-white version.

 Please post your suggestions on the jeuclid-devel mailing list.
