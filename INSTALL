General
-------

All the default converters currently use the Arial Unicode MS font. This font is
included with Microsoft Office 2000 and 2003. You should make sure that you have
this font installed on your system. This dependency will be removed in a future
release.


Cocoon
------

If you want to use JEuclid as a cocoon component, you will have to download the
older version of JEuclid <= 2


Embedd
------

To embedd JEUclid into your application add the JAR files from build/jars and 
the needed JAR files from lib to your classpath.


Ant
---

To use the ANT task define the converter task:
  <taskdef name="mmlconverter" 
   classname="net.sourceforge.jeuclid.ant.MathMLConverter">
with the needed JAR files in the classpath.


Command line conversion
-----------------------

You may use the included mml2xxx scripts for command line conversion.
